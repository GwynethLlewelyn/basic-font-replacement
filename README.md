# Basic Font Replacement WordPress Plugin

A very basic WordPress plugin just to add some extra locally stored fonts.

Note that this repository is in "pseudo"-Subversion format, to better accomodate to WordPress's desired directory organisation. This means that the actual plugin will be under the `trunk/` directory; that's what you should upload to your WordPress installation! (But create the directory for the plugin first.)

Per convention, the top-level directory of this Git repository has lots of development tools that are not published to the WordPress plugin directory and are useless except for development purposes.

There might be more information available on the usual [readme](tags/0.0.1/readme.txt).
