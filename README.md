# Basic Font Replacement WordPress Plugin

A very basic WordPress plugin just to add some extra locally stored fonts.

Note that this repository is in "pseudo"-Subversion format, to better accomodate to WordPress's desired directory organisation. This means that the actual pliugin will be under the `trunk/` directory; that's what one you should upload to your WordPress installation!

There might be more information available on the usual [readme](tags/0.0.1/readme.txt).
